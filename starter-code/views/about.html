    <p>Initially believed to have been born on Earth, Goku later learns that he is a member of an extraterrestrial
        warrior race called the Saiyans, which is also the reason for his superhuman strength, and his birth name is
        Kakarot (カカロット, Kakarotto). As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and protects his adopted
        home planet from those who seek to destroy it. Goku is depicted as carefree and cheerful when at ease, but
        quickly serious and strategic-minded when in battle and also enthusiastic to fight. He is able to concentrate
        his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks; the most prominent being his signature
        Kamehameha (かめはめ波), in which Goku launches a blue energy blast from his palms. Also pure of heart, Goku has
        frequently granted mercy to his enemies, which has often earned him additional allies in the process (though
        has also resulted in others taking advantage of his kindness), and he is one of the few who can ride the magic
        cloud called Kinto'un (筋斗雲, lit. "Somersault Cloud", renamed "Flying Nimbus" in Funimation's dub); which was
        another element adapted from Journey to the West.[3]
